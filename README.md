# Project Overview
This project trains a neural network model (MLPRegressor) to predict median house values in California using the California Housing dataset from scikit-learn. The available features in the dataset are scaled and passed into the model with early stopping mechanism and some customized hyperparameters. Model performance is evaluated using predicted vs actual scatter plots for both train and test partitions.
## Collaboration Workflow
This project was completed by two group members using GitHub branches and pull requests. Both partners reviewed each other’s code and provided feedback through pull request reviews.
## How to Run

- Clone the repository using GitHub Desktop
- Install required packages in the repository directory:
-  Run the code : python src/code.py

## Outputs

Two scatter plots representing model performance for training and test datasets will be generated in the `figs/` directory.
